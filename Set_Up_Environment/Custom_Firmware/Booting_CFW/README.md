# **Booting CFW(Hekate)**

In order to boot the Nintendo Switch in CFW, you need to enter Recovery Mode (RCM). The tools you need to enter RCM are RCM Jig (required) and RCM Loader (optional). If you don't have a RCM Jig, you can make it through paper clips, and if you don't have an RCM Loader, you can connect with your PC and replace the Loader [^4].

## RCM Loader & Jig

Below is a picture of RCM loader and Jig.
